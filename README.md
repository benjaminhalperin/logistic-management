# logistic-management
The project presented here is realized in a large part of it using tools and knowledge acquired in the advanced design courses.
The purpose of the web site presented is to demonstrate the preparation of a technical portfolio for the management of logistical support activities in the operation of surveillance sites deployed along a sensitive sector that must be monitored.
The project consists of a number of surveillance sites whose topographic layout covers the areas of the monitored sector and also shows each site picture.
Site number 2 indicated in the top navigation menu can be opened to demonstrate the technical information demo related to maintenance - meaning: site equipment details, site construction procedure, technical explanation of all equipment on site, site operation inspection procedure, display of spare parts using close-up photos and “hot areas” for link to relevant documents.
A special emphasis in the web site design is the implementation of a user-friendly and immediate approach for user technical information repository.
