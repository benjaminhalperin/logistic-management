The project presented here is realized in a large part of it using tools and knowledge acquired in the advanced design courses.

The purpose of the web site presented is to demonstrate the preparation of a technical portfolio for the management of logistical support activities in the operation of surveillance sites deployed along a sensitive sector that must be monitored.
